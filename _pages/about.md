# 👀 About Me
Hi there! I am in my third year as an undergraduate student at the College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University. Now, I worked as a research assistant in the Radio Lab, advised by Dr. [Sean (Xuefeng) Du](https://d12306.github.io/). Previously, I worked as a research assistant in the Graphics Imaging and Media Computing Group, under the guidance of [Dr. Fanhua Shang](https://sites.google.com/site/fanhua217/home).

My current research focus is to develop theory and algorithms for reliable machine learning (ML), foundation model reliability, and related applications.

# 🧩 Research Interests
- **Out-of-distribution (OOD) research**: Semantic/covariate shifts, adversarial and noisy Samples.  
- **Reliability of foundation models**: Model hallucination detection and mitigation.  
- **Alignment of foundation Models**: LLMs, VLMs.

I am very excited about potential collaboration opportunities! You can find my [CV](../assets/CV-Ethan%20Si.pdf) here. If you share similar research interests and find my work interesting, I warmly welcome you to add my [Wechat](../images/wechat.jpg) for further discussion!
