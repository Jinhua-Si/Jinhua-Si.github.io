# 👀 About Me
Hi there! I’m a research assistant at Purdue University, Department of Computer Science, advised by [Dr. Ruqi Zhang](https://ruqizhang.github.io/). I am also in my third year as an undergraduate student at the College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University. Previously, I worked as a research assistant in the Graphics Imaging and Media Computing Group, under the guidance of [Dr. Fanhua Shang](https://sites.google.com/site/fanhua217/home).

My research interests lie in developing reliable machine learning algorithms and frameworks for real-world applications, with a particular focus on the alignment of Large Foundation Models (LLMs and VLMs) and the generalization of multimodal learning algorithms.


# 🧩 Research Interests
- **Multimodal Learning**: Multimodal Fusion, Imbalanced Multimodal Learning.  
- **Alignment of Foundation Models**: LLMs, VLMs.  
- **Trustworthy AI**: Safety, Uncertainty, etc.

I am very excited about potential collaboration opportunities! You can find my [CV](../assets/CV-Jinhua%20Si-EN.pdf) here. If you share similar research interests and find my work interesting, I warmly welcome you to add my [Wechat](../images/wechat.jpg) for further discussion!
